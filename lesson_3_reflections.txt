When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Remote repositories are good for collaborating with other people as well as having a backup that's readily available to pull.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Pulling changes manually allows you to focus on whatever you're working on without dealing with code that was pushed to the remote by other collaborators. This isolates you're unit of work to the state of your branch on your local machine, and if any bugs arise, you're sure it's only for code you committed to your local. Also, automatically pulling code might not be compatible with the code on your local making it susceptible to break.
