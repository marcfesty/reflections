What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Initializing the repository creates the necessary metadata that tracks all the changes within the repository. Without this, any changes made will not be seen by git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?

	The staging area represents the changes to be committed. Anything not included will not be committed.

What value do you think it offers?
	This offers complete control to what gets committed as part of the logical change.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	The staging area is where you put in all changes before a commit. If you use git diff --staged, you will see all the different changes you made and from there, decide which changes should logically go together.
